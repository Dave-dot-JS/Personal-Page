				Hi everybody!  I am Dave and welcome to my drumming blog! I have been playing drums on and off (mostly off) for about 20 years.  Most of my early time playing was done throughout high school with a rad punk band called Blindfold Carl.  I stopped playing drums regularly around 2005 when that band split, and then took a 12-year break from drumming, instead focusing exclusively on guitar, and played lead guitar in a few bands in the 2010s around the Hamilton/GTA area.  <br /><br />When I moved to Toronto, a friend had me audition on drums for a local band called Low Hanging Lights.  I went in, 12-years rusty, and pretty much tanked the auditions.  This became my motivation for re-discovering the instrument.  I met this really cool Toronto jazz drummer (who has since moved to Vancouver BC) who let me sublet his 10x10 drum room in the basement of a downtown rehearsal space for an incredible price and in 2014, and after months and months of practice, I auditioned for my first real band <a href="sixteenscandals.com" target="_blank">Sixteen Scandals</a>.  We clicked right away, and have been playing together ever since.<br /><br />In summer of 2018, I took a road trip with my good friends in the band <a href="https://welovetalkshowhost.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Talk Show Host</a> to see Alkaline Trio play in Buffalo.  More on that in my first blog post but suffice to say it was inspirational and gave me the bump I needed to really commit to practicing.  So after that weekend I decided that I would commit recording and posting at least one cover song per month, and write about my experience learning and performing the song.  This is where all of those posts go! In addition to practice posts, I will also share clips from live shows and from the recording studio with 	<a href="https://sixteenscandals.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Sixteen Scandals</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!

				<h2>November 2, 2018:  Incubus - Rogues<br />Cover Video</h2>
				<p>Hello again!  Check it out! Three videos in a row within a reasonable time frame of each other?? I may actually be getting okay-er at this whole blog thing!  This entry is going to take a bit of a departure from the punk tunes and get a bit "progressive" with the song Rogues by Incubus, original drums written/performed by Jose Pasillas.</p>
				<p>So Jose is actually one of the main drummers that got me back into playing drums after taking a long multi-year break after high school. His parts are always really creative, and he seems to put a lot of thought not only into keeping rhythm but also what specific drum sound will fit the part of the song.  I guess you could call him a "melodic" drummer.  That's my opinion anyways.  Rogues has always been one of my favourite parts of his, and you can definitely see parts of this song lifted and "repurposed" in a whole bunch of <a href="sixteenscandals.com" target="_blank">Sixteen Scandals</a> songs off of our album <a href="https://sixteenscandals.bandcamp.com/album/create-destroy" target="_blank">Create//Destroy</a>.  The bell-pattern in the intro (pre-verse? man screw these songs and their wonky structures) can be heard in the pre-chorus of the opening track Pain, and I took a lot of inspiration from the chorus of this song in the pre-chorus of our song #Asshat.  In fact I think that I used literally the same set of three fills in that song....multiple times.  Oops.</p>
				<p>Although this song is slower than some of the past covers I've done, I would rate it marginally harder than most (Don't tell Chris but I think this one was actually took more takes than Propagandhi). The verses never really fall into a groove so it's really difficult to keep meter.  Alot of the fills come in groupings of three which means you are either doing a single stroke and using your off-hand for the cymbal hit at the end, or making it pa-diddle-ra (?) I don't know what the RLLR pattern is actually called...  Also the parts in general just aren't what I would have intuitively written for the section (my interpretation would have made Incubus not famous). It took a lot of listens and re-listens to correctly place the kick drum in the bridge, and none of the longer fills repeat themselves so it was sometimes hard doing multiple takes in a row and trying to remember which one went with the chorus that's about to come up.  Overall I think it's a pretty solid cover.  I added an extra eighth-note somewhere by accident.  Comment on the youtube video if you can find where!  Also apologies for the low volume of the backing track.  The drums are mixed so damn loud in the original song that I had to take it way down so that they didn't cover up my actual drum sounds.</p>
				<p>That's all for this entry!  As always, feel free to reach out using the Contact form below.  Thank you Mike for your feedback last week, I am definitely going to check out the song you suggested!</p>

				<h2>October 22, 2018:  Talk Show Host - Skull and Bones<br />Cover Video</h2>
				<p>Hey everybody!  After taking very long to record my past few blog entries, I've been hard at work trying to get more videos together so that I have things to post more regularly. This specific video came from my practice session yesterday, and is a cover of the song Skull and Bones by my favourite local Toronto band <a href="https://welovetalkshowhost.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Talk Show Host</a> and is performed by Sean Woolven on the drums. For their benefit, I've also embedded the original tune on Spotify.  Go give them all your streamz!!</p>
				<p>This song was a ton of fun to learn, and came together super quickly.  I love the momentum the drum part creates, alternating between the quarter-note snare & kick combo and the typical eighth-note alternating pattern (the "Thrash" beat).  I also dig the little snare roll that ends the first bar of each verse/pre-verse.  I kept trying to place it as a flam in my head, but when I sat down at the kit and played I realized that it's just a regular triplet roll with the first hit being on the ride (or hi-hat...or floor tom) and the second 2 hits being on the snare.  Executing it cleanly is very very important because at this song's tempo any looseness in this roll can noticeably throw off the song's timing, or even worse, sound like a mistake.  But when it hits clean, it adds even more forward drive to an already driven song.</p>
				<p>Man, this song is also catchy as all heck. I ended up playing it for another hour after the recording just so I could keep listening to it. I know I know, it would have been smarter to leave the camera running and get a better take after practicing it like 18 more times, but who wants to sift through that much video?! This take came out pretty darn tight anyways I think! Hope you all enjoyed!  As always, send me comments, feedback, or suggestions of what to cover next in the Contact form below!

				<h2>October 15, 2018:  Propagandhi - Failed Imagineer<br />Progress Update #1</h2>
				<p>Hello again!  Back again with a new cover, this time I decided to try covering a tune with more interesting time signatures; Failed Imagineer by Propagandhi.  This is one of my favourite tunes off their new album, and has been a blast to learn so far.  This video comes after about three practice sessions.  The first session was spent almost entirely writing down a rough transcription of the song's time signatures by bar.  Once that was nailed down, I had thought, learning the parts won't be so hard.  Hell, I just came off of learning a light-speed Alkaline Trio song, this would be a welcome break...I was wrong.</p>
				<p>So this song actually clocks in around 165 - 170 bpm (depending on which mobile metronome app I'm using).  It's fast.  But honestly, since I've spent the last couple months working solely on fast songs, it came together quicker than I thought.  All that time focusing on relaxation and loose grip really paid off.</p>
				<p>As far as the video goes, I think it was actually a pretty decent take.  Not a ton of timing issues, however I think the quiet tom-part in the bridge (...?  what the hell is the structure of this song even) isn't played exactly how it is played on the record.  I will have to dig deeper into that part for the next recording. Anyways, enjoy! And as always, hit up the contact form below to get in touch with feedback, suggestions, or general banter!</p>

				<h2>October 1, 2018:  Better Late Than Never! Alkaline Trio - I Found Away<br />Full Song</h2>
				<p>Hey again everyone!  Apologies for the long haitus, my practice time the past few weeks has been dominated by <a href="sixteenscandals.com" target="_blank">Sixteen Scandals</a> preparing for our gigs at Cherry Colas in Toronto and at the Dropped On Droillard Festival in Windsor.  They were some amazing shows, shame on you for not being there (or thank you if you were!).
				</p>
				<p>Anyways, it's time for the final installment of I Found Away by Alkaline Trio.  Despite distractions I did manage to learn the full tune and get an 'acceptable' take recorded in the space!  See the <a href="https://vimeo.com/292524980" target="_blank">video</a> here.  Now don't get me wrong, it isn't a perfect take.  There's definitely still some timing issues, especially with the big	 fill at the end.  With this tune, the biggest and most difficult lesson I learned was staying loose.  I've been drumming on and off for probably about 10 years now (more off than on...) and I had no idea how often I tensed up until I caught it all on video.  When learning the song I was struggling with stamina.  I could play up to the second chorus fine, but after that the speedy speedy 16ths on the hi-hat begin to take their toll and my forearms would give out causing the rest of the song to get sloppy or downright unplayable at times.  Once I began to really focus on relaxing my shoulders and loosening my grip on the sticks, especially during the faster fills, my stamina improved dramatically.  In terms of parts, the song turned out easier to learn than I expected.  The chorus groove, once nailed down, isn't complicated to play. It's more the speed and length of the song that poses an issue.  I will say though, the outro groove with the alternating sticking pattern on the hi-hat was very difficult to internalize.  I'm not sure if Derek Grant uses the same sticking pattern that I landed on for this performance, but it seemed the only reasonable way to play it given the speed of the song.</p>
				<p>So although it isn't perfect, I am going to call this cover "Done" as far as this blog is concerned.  But I will definitely be adding it to my regular practice rotation to really tighten it up.  I had some trouble finding what song to tackle next, but after some talks with my friends in (amazing local band alert!) <a href="https://welovetalkshowhost.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Talk Show Host</a> I think that I will try Failed Imagineer by Propagandhi. No time limit on this one, I will just post updates as I get time to make them.  Thanks again for reading! And as always, feel free to get in touch using the contact form below!</p>

				<h2>September 3, 2018:  Bonus Videos!<br />Sixteen Scandals Studio Sessions - Dorkmanteau & Moremanteau</h2>
				<p>Hey everyone!  Back for another week.  Don't worry, I have been practicing to I Found Away, in fact last week I managed to make it to the end of the tune (not cleanly at all of course, but still a couple weeks to go!). Unfortunately, I forgot my camera at home while rehearsing last week.  So in the meantime I figured I would share some Sixteen Scandals videos!</p>
				<p>There are three videos I have to share from the recording of Sixteen Scandals' albums <a href="https://sixteenscandals.bandcamp.com/album/dorkmanteau" target="_blank">Dorkmanteau and Moremanteau</a>.  All of these were recorded in Kingston, ON with our engineer Greg Dawson of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gergbwcstudios/" target="_blank">BWC Studios</a>.  We recorded the drums for this entire record in one 14-hour session in the nicest studio I've ever seen, North of Princess studios.  It was a tough session.  The tempo I had been practising the songs to sounded far too slow once we laid them down, so we had to up everything by about 5 bpm on the spot. It took a bit of adapting, but we got it done!  The three videos shared here are three songs from that session, recorded with my GoPro.</p>
				<p>The first song shown is the opening track of the record and the first track laid down in this session, Traffuck.  Disclaimer, I totally copied the intro pattern from a <a href="https://youtu.be/iJy8VgB83OQ?t=15s" target="_blank">FIDLAR</a> song without noticing, but hey, there's only so different orders you can hit the drums in! This was actually the toughest song on the album to record, as it was the slowest and had some interesting kick-placement in the fills between verses.  I think that about 95% of the take in this video was used as the final take of the song.  My favourite part is the 5-beat stop around the 1:30 mark...the band still hates me for that one.</p>
				<p>The second video is Flawsophy.  Unfortunately I couldn't find the final take of this song, but the take I did manage to get on video was close!  You'll definitely notice a couple times that the drums don't match the backing track though. This tune is probably my favourite to play live right now; when writing the song I really tried to focus on open-handed playing, especially for the "It's all about you" part of the chorus using left hand for hi-hat and right hand for snare at the end of the fill instead of crossing over.</p>
				<p>Lastly, I swallow my pride and post a scapped take of Adolessons; my favourite song on Dorkmanteau and the last song we recorded that day. Unfortunately my GoPro battery died after this take.  The take was done at the old speed (hence no backing track), 5 bpm too slow, and I completely blew the first fill in the second verse.  But hey! I still think it's a cool video, and a cool drum part. I think it's one of the coolest parts I've written.  I love the bell work on the choruses and the breakdowns at the end.  This one is a beast to play live.  Even at 5 bpm slower you can tell that I was getting a bit fatigued.</p>
				<p>Anyways, hope you enjoyed the session tapes! I'll be dropping another progress video of I Found Away this week and hopefully wrap it up by next week.  As always, feel free to send me comments, suggestions, or recommendations of songs to cover in the Contact form below!</p>

				<h2>August 23, 2018:  Alkaline Trio - I Found Away<br />Progress Update #1</h2>
				<p>This whole idea of making a drum blog came out of seeing Alkaline Trio live and watching their drummer (Jarrod Alexander filling in for Derek Grant) completely rip it up. So it is only appropriate that the first song I open this blog with be one of theirs. The drumming of I Found Away has always intrigued me. Specifically the chorus; it's one of those drum parts that you bang your head against for hours trying to figure out what the hell he's playing. You know it's a double-time hi-hat but the placement of the open note and the sticking pattern are tough to pin down. After finding a take of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A01Aaf83fA" target="_blank" alt='youtube video of isolated drum track'>drum track</a> (thanks Derek Grant!) and reviewing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbErJY9XC1E" target="_blank" alt="live video of I Found Away">live video</a>, I think I've nailed it down.</p>
				<p>This first set of videos comes out of about 1.5 hours of practice (including warm-ups). The first hour was spent learning the parts...which including practicing the chorus wrong for 30 minutes. In that time I was able to get through the first verse and chorus. The last bit of the session, I set up the GoPro and went through as many takes as I could until my arms got stiff. In the end I got one decent take a full-speed and one take at 135 bpm to show the sticking. I split the session into two videos. One with the slow take and the full-speed take with no backing track, and one full-speed take with the backing track.</p>
				<p>There were a few things I found difficult with this tune so far: first is obviously the speed. This track is stinking fast! And with the entire song being played with 16th notes on the hi-hat it can burn you out quickly. I was actually surprised that the verse is harder to tighten up than the chorus. The chorus, although tricky to figure out, flows pretty easily once you get going. The four-to-the-floor kick can be played pretty much absent-mindedly leaving plenty of mental space to focus on not screwing up the hi-hat part. But in the verse the placement of the kick pedals, specifically at the beginning of the first couple bars, is tough to place cleanly.</p>
				<p>Anyways, that is it for this week! I have just over 3 weeks left to get this song down in full. For the next two weeks I'm hoping to learn up to the end of the song, and then I will spend the last week tightening it up to a click-track for the final share. See you then!</p>
