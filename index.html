					<!-- Introduction and Personal Summary -->
					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Hi, I'm Dave and this is a page about me and the stuff I do.</p><br />
					<p>By day I'm a Finance professional, and for the past 5+ years have been working in the Actuarial field of the P&C insurance industry.  This means that numbers, statistics, and risk analysis are my bread and butter.  And I love programming. Leveraging my strong background in statistics I am working to enter the field of Data Science with a specific focus on Machine Learning.  I've completed a variety of certificate-based courses online covering the topics of Statistical Learning, Deep Learning, and Data analysis as well as the applications of these concepts using tools like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Octave.  I am continuously working to educate myself, often balancing multiple courses at a time.</p><br />
					<p>I also do web development as a hobby.  I made this website! It isn't terrible! I completed a part-time course on Front-end Web Development at Bitmaker GA in downtown Toronto in 2017, and do my best to keep active by attending meetups in Toronto and working on projects whenever I have time.  You can see some of my Machine Learning and Web Development programming work <a href="https://www.github.com/dave-dot-js" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br />
					<p>By night, I'm an active musician in the Toronto music scene. I currently play drums in two projects; an alt-rock band called <a href="https://sixteenscandals.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Sixteen Scandals</a> and a folk project called <a href="https://www.thesunharmonic.com" target="_blank">The Sun Harmonic</a>. I maintain a drum <a href="drum-blog.html">blog</a> that I update regularly including covers and clips from the studio!</p><br />
					<p>I am also an assistant instructor at <a href="https://www.oldschoolmuaythai.com/" target="_blank">Old School Muay Thai</a>, where I run Muay Thai technique and conditioning classes once a week. In whatever time is left over I enjoy building and painting warhammer models and playing role-playing games and boardgames. You could really say that my main hobby is collecting hobbies.</p>
